## 🧭 Overview

This project was conducted as part of my **Data Analyst Internship at InnoByte Services**.  
The goal was to analyze **Amazon sales performance data** to uncover insights related to **product performance, fulfillment efficiency, customer behavior, and regional sales trends** — ultimately providing **actionable recommendations** to optimize business strategies and boost profitability.

These issues lead to missed revenue opportunities and inefficient decision-making.
